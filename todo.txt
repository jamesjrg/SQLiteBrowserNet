todo now:
- each query tab is associated with its own results tab and messages tab, this requires some rejigging. for browsing tables, make a new query window with equivalent query for browse appear. for editing tables, datagrid appears in a tab in queriestabs, not in results tabs

- messages tab should always appear at end of results tabs or not at all. should have actual sqlite messages. should always exist and never actually have its reference removed from resultstabs list, rather just gets filtered from view if it gets closed. should use try/catch to catch sql errors and display them

- make the basic treeview of database work - tables, indexes, right click to view schema or contents

- add some unit tests, and perhaps start doing write test first programming

Plan:
- a bit of a cross between sqlitebrowser and SQL Sever Management Studio, including features from both (where applicable)

UI:
- two bars at top, one is always constant (file, view, help, etc), the other is context sensitive depending on whether focus in object explorer, query window, or results window
- context sensitive things for query: open, save, run, cancel. for results: export, select all, copy, copy with headers. for obj explorer win: view top 200, view all, edit top 200
- have undo/redo for query windows
- rest v similar to msssms - object explorer on left, tabbed query windows windows on top, tabbed results panes and messages panes on bottom. rather than having properties windows from object epxlorer open in new windows, make them open tabs in bottom section as well. also, no properties window on right.
- ideally the various sections are hidable/dockable/resizable/etc
- to query either results or schema of anything in tree, can either right click on tree, or use icon#

stuff:
- ctrl t / ctrl f4 open/close query tabs, also closing results/schema tabs
- * in title bar if modified without saving, same with queries
- grey out menu items and toolbar icons when not useable
- have shortcut key listed next to each menu item
- make shortcut keys work
- should be able to execute (or otherwise sensibly error) balnk queries, malformed queries, etc
- tooltips for toolbare and tree and long items in results
- don't hang if query when not connected to db
- don't hang if enter invalid sql, e.g. select * from foo where isnull(bar)
- allow select/copy/export of result sets
- exporting either data or result sets give options of ascii, utf, csv ascii, cvs utf8 etc
- support foreign keys
- recent databases menu option
- work with tables that have names like at::GeotechnicalMeasurementPoint
- make browser work with tables named "group", and with tables named "8digit"
- allow adding a field named "delete"
- save/load queries
- tabbed query windows
- view top 100/1000/all results in browser
- also, look at sql server management studio for other ideas
- many commands should be available in menu, in menu with shortcut, via own app-wide shortcut, and via right clicking
- make resizing with grid splitters work properly at all times
- results panes should be read only, but still selectable and copyable
- messages in messages tab should have icons
- maybe merge resultstabs and querytabs classes, and hen eithe give them parameters fro templates, or have a common subclass to the two?
